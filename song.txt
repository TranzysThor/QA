[Verse 1: GRIP]
Look, I can walk you through the depths of hell where vexed rejects elect to sell
Keep TECs to protect your tail
No respected male to blaze a separate trail 'cause, uh, they was inept as well
Inherited they debt, we set to fail, please reset the scale
Niggas clappin' on Saturday, but we ain't see SNL
No comedy skits, just llamas and sticks and drama and shit
Baby mamas and jits, piranhas and pits, and product to pitch
Honestly, it's only right I give the zombies a fix
This bass to your facе from a speaker make you a twеaker
I laced it with ether
It'll take you a week to
Bounce back off one hit of this
Niggas is clitoris, way too frivolous
This is far more dire
The bars is hardcore like parkour with barbed wire
GRIP is the dark horse that spark wars and start fires
Hole in one on a par of four or higher, and your supplier
Tour guide for hire, poor guy, he's tired
Cut him some slack, he's strapped, rap to his back

[Chorus: GRIP]
Back to the wall and they all against me
Love on my mind, but it's cash to earn
I was hopin' maybe we could ball eventually
If only one time 'fore we crash and burn
Fully furnished crib, but inside, you're empty
'Cause you chose rap as your favorite girl
Could've fooled me, can't save the world
Could've fooled me, can't save the world
Back to the wall and they all against me
Love on my mind, but it's cash to earn
I was hopin' maybe we could ball eventually
If only one time 'fore we crash and burn
Fully furnished crib, but inside, you're empty
'Cause you chose rap as your favorite girl
Could've fooled me, can't save the world
Could've fooled me, can't save the world
