[Verse 1: GRIP]
Look, I can walk you through the depths of hell where vexed rejects elect to sell
Keep TECs to protect your tail
No respected male to blaze a separate trail 'cause, uh, they was inept as well
Inherited they debt, we set to fail, please reset the scale
Niggas clappin' on Saturday, but we ain't see SNL
No comedy skits, just llamas and sticks and drama and shit
Baby mamas and jits, piranhas and pits, and product to pitch
Honestly, it's only right I give the zombies a fix
This bass to your facе from a speaker make you a twеaker
I laced it with ether
It'll take you a week to
Bounce back off one hit of this
Niggas is clitoris, way too frivolous
This is far more dire
The bars is hardcore like parkour with barbed wire
GRIP is the dark horse that spark wars and start fires
Hole in one on a par of four or higher, and your supplier
Tour guide for hire, poor guy, he's tired
Cut him some slack, he's strapped, rap to his back

[Chorus: GRIP]
Back to the wall and they all against me
Love on my mind, but it's cash to earn
I was hopin' maybe we could ball eventually
If only one time 'fore we crash and burn
Fully furnished crib, but inside, you're empty
'Cause you chose rap as your favorite girl
Could've fooled me, can't save the world
Could've fooled me, can't save the world
Back to the wall and they all against me
Love on my mind, but it's cash to earn
I was hopin' maybe we could ball eventually
If only one time 'fore we crash and burn
Fully furnished crib, but inside, you're empty
'Cause you chose rap as your favorite girl
Could've fooled me, can't save the world
Could've fooled me, can't save the world

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yeah
Sometimes I wonder, really, what did my closed head injury do?
I'm literally missin' a screw, but it seems like my memory's too vivid to forget the shit I've been through (Yeah)
So as my residuals grew, I remembered those kids who were cruel
Same individuals at Elizabeth Little and essentially used them as the fuel
Who would've knew what a pencil could do though, so mentally screwed
They said, "Marshall, you're either gonna wind up dead or in the penitentiary
'Cause eventually you'll end up clenchin' a tool
And come back vengefully to shoot them bullies who clowned you in elementary school"
Yeah, my head, something's wrong with it (Yeah)
But that makes me me, I'm different (Yup)
That lyrical phenom misfit
Since I was a bleach blond, you hear the beat on this
Which makes me only think of demonic shit (What?)
I was knockin' at death's door (Yep), I fuckin' ding-dong ditched it (Haha, yeah)
Yeah, and I don't do that sing-song bitch shit (Yeah)
And I don't use Auto-Tune, all I do is spit, and this shit just bothers you
Call it quits, bitch, impossible
My pen just popped your thought balloon
You dipshits know how I'ma do it
Send the motherfucking beat to the trauma-unit
Yeah, Shady Records, look at all these squad killers we brought with us
Juggernauts and Godzillas, you don't rock with us, you're off of your rockers
Bitch, back's to the wall as it always is
Why I'm not talkin' about wallets and knots
When I say that the wall it is not against
It's more like the cross (Cross), look at how far this is past you
Regardless, you want me to reach a fuckin' bar that does not exist
No pun intended, but GRIP, hold on to this moment
'Cause soon as you reach the top, they're gonna want you to fall from it (Yeah)
So you better grab your seatbelt like I did mine, and fasten yours
Like a motherfucking plane-crash passenger
'Cause one day, you'll be crashing back to Earth
And if you don't ever stop to smell the roses
I do know one thing, that's for sure
You don't get your flowers 'til you're pushin' up daisies (No)
And that's about all your ashes earn

[Chorus: GRIP]
Back to the wall and they all against me
Love on my mind, but it's cash to earn
I was hopin' maybe we could ball eventually
If only one time 'fore we crash and burn
Fully furnished crib, but inside, you're empty
'Cause you chose rap as your favorite girl
Could've fooled me, can't save the world
Could've fooled me, can't save the world
Back to the wall and they all against me
Love on my mind, but it's cash to earn
I was hopin' maybe we could ball eventually
If only one time 'fore we crash and burn
Fully furnished crib, but inside, you're empty
'Cause you chose rap as your favorite girl
Could've fooled me, can't save the world
Could've fooled me, can't save the world
